Grading
This project is worth 100 points total, but counts as a project in that category and as an exam in that category for purposes of grading. We use points for each feature in the rubric because of the open-ended nature of the project and because this is the final exam and there won’t be an in-class post-project review. We don’t want to encourage the idea that partial credit for non-compliant code is is OK.
